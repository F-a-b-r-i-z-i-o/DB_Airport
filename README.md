# DB_Airport
A very simple example of an airport database.

The database was created by defining logical based constraints. 
To verify the correct functioning, query queries based on relational algebra have been defined. 
In addition, triggers have been used that take care of automatically updating flights once the flight has been added or canceled.

The project was implemented with Postgresql
